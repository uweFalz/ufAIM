# ufAIM app (playground)

This folder contains an experimental interactive playground (2D/3D + transition editor overlay).
It is intentionally lightweight and evolves quickly.

- ✅ showable: interactive concepts, UI wiring, early maths
- ❌ not yet: production structure, import/export, solver integration

If something feels rough: that's the point — we're making the knowledge explicit.
